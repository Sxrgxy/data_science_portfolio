## [A/B Test Results](https://github.com/Sxrgxy/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Ab_test_results_anlysis.ipynb)

A/B tests are commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Our goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

**Result**: Performed hypothesis Testing and concluded the new page has brought no more based on the results of hypothesis.

**Skills used**: data cleaning, visualisation, hypothesis testing, logistic regression

## [Mobile Game Data Analysis](https://github.com/Sxrgxy/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Mobile_game_data_analysis.ipynb)

We are given a dataset containing the event logs for the first 500 levels of a mobile game. Based on the data, we will do the following:
Suggest and calculate a metric describing the difficulty of levels.
Based on the level difficulty metric, divide the levels into groups by complexity. Analyze the density of complex levels in the game.
Calculate a Levels Completion "Funnel" for a new user.

**Result**: metric propostition, density of a distribution, Funnel

**Skills used**: data cleaning, visualisation, product metrics,funnel

## [Transactions Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/Sxrgxy/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Online_retail_metrics.ipynb)

We are given a dataset that contains transactions, occurred between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011, for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts, and the majority of the company's customers are wholesalers. Based on the transactions data, we will study the performance of the retailer and calculate several Product Metrics associated with it.

**Result**: The steep drop of Sales Revenue identified and analysed the cuases of the drop.

**Skills used**: data cleaning, visualisation, product metrics
