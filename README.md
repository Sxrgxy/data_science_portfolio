## [A/B Test Results](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Sxrgxy/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Ab_test_results_anlysis.ipynb)

For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Our goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make a decision.

**Result**: conducted a hypothesis testing and failed to reject the Null Hypothesis, meaning that the new page didn't bring more conversions.

**Skills used**: data cleaning, visualisation, hypothesis testing, logistic regression

## [Mobile Game Data Analysis](https://github.com/Sxrgxy/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Mobile_game_data_analysis.ipynb)

During the project, we will be working with logs for the first 500 levels of a mobile game. We suggest and calculate a "Level Difficulty" metric, divide the game levels into groups by complexity, construct a Levels Completion "Funnel".

**Result**: two metrics propostition, density of levels by difficulty, levels completion funnel

**Skills used**: data cleaning, visualisation, product metrics, funnel

## [Transactions Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/Sxrgxy/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Online_retail_metrics.ipynb)

We are given a dataset that contains transactions, occurred between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011, for a UK-based online retailer. Based on the transaction data, we study the performance of the retailer and calculate vital Product Metrics associated with it.

**Result**: the steep drop of Sales Revenue identified and analysed the cuases of the drop.

**Skills used**: data cleaning, visualisation, product metrics

## [Customer Segmentation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Sxrgxy/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Customer_segmentation.ipynb)

We again work with the transactional dataset, the same as is in the [Transactions Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/Sxrgxy/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Online_retail_metrics.ipynb) project. We now conduct Customer Segmentation using the RFM method and K-Means clustering ML algorithm.

**Result**: each customer is assigned to a Segement based on its RFM score. 

**Skills used**: visualisation, K-Means, RFM method
